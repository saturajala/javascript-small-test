# javascript-small-test
A Finnish - Swedish dictionary using JavaScript

 (I used a basic Bootstrap-base which I added to the project. All the relevant code snippets are in files 
 ******** index.html and js/main.js ********)

Features:
- User can add a new word pair (to JavaScript array, database-version will be added later)
  - A bootstrap modal shows the words that have been added
- User can search the words (default, from finnish to swedish)
  - If the word isn't in the array, user gets a message stating that
  - If the word is in the array, it will be shown to user
- User can also change from FI - SE to SE - FI and back again

 
 Other comments:
 - This is a small Javascript-test where I test the basics (for -loop, if - else, variables and arrays)
 - I will later try to make a version where the information is saved to a database
